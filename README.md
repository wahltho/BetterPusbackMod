# About BetterPushback Mod X-Plane 11/12

This is a pushback plugin for the X-Plane 11/12 flight simulator.
It provides an overhead view to plan a pushback route and
accomplishes a fully automated "hands-off" pushback, letting the user
focus on aircraft startup and other pilot duties during pushback. It can
of course also tow you forward, or perform any arbitrarily complicated
pushback operation. To increase immersion, it speaks to you in a variety
of languages and accents, simulating ground staff at various places
around the world.

### About this Fork and Copyright

Better Pushback is developed by "Saso Kiselkov". So if you see this project or else, just contact me.
I just did it, to "keep it a life on X-Plane 12". I will always respect that this is your code,
and you are the father of this application. Hope you accept this as there was no answer from your side.

There is no idea to steal it from you. If you don't like this effort. Just say and I will stop it, no question.

Thanks

## Building BetterPushback

This checkout is intended to stay as the authoritative source tree. Build
artifacts now live under `~/dev/BPB` by default so the iCloud-backed source
directory stays free of generated output. Run `../workbench/sync_local_workspace.sh`
to refresh the local workspace, or use `../workbench/relocate_build_artifacts.sh`
once to move any existing build output there.

To build BetterPushback, check to see you have the pre-requisites installed. The
Linux and Windows versions are built in one step on an Ubuntu 16.04 (or
compatible) machine and the Mac version is obviously built on macOS (10.9
or later).

>Note: __on macOS only__ , by using the option ```-f```, the script will build also the linux and windows versions. see ```README-docker.md```.  

For the Linux and Mac build pre-requisites, see ```build_xpl.sh```

The global build script is located here and is called '```build_release```'.
Once you have the pre-requisite build packages installed, simply run:
***
```
$ ./build_release [-f]
```
This builds the dependencies and then proceeds to build BetterPushback for the appropriate target platforms. Please note that this builds a
stand-alone version of the plugin that is to be installed into the global
Resources/plugins directory in X-Plane.
***
```
$ ./build_xpl_sh [-f] 
```
This build only the .xpl file. (option described above can be used)
***
```
$ ./install_xplane.sh
```
Copy the .xpl files to the x-plane and change the quarantine attribute of the ```mac.xpl``` file. The script prefers artifacts from `~/dev/BPB/BetterPusbackMod-main` if present.
In the script, just set ```XPLANE_PLUGIN_DIR``` accordingly.

For details on how to add tug liveries, see
`objects/tugs/LIVERIES_HOWTO.txt`.

To add a voice set, see `data/msgs/README.txt` for the information.

## Commands

BetterPushback registers these X-Plane commands:

- `BetterPushback/start`: Start pushback (or connect-first if configured).
- `BetterPushback/stop`: Stop pushback.
- `BetterPushback/start_planner`: Open the pushback planner.
- `BetterPushback/stop_planner`: Close the pushback planner.
- `BetterPushback/connect_first`: Connect the tug before planning/pushback.
- `BetterPushback/cab_camera`: View from the tug cab.
- `BetterPushback/recreate_scenery_routes`: Recreate scenery routes from WED files.
- `BetterPushback/preference`: Open the preference window.
- `BetterPushback/reload`: Reload BetterPushback (disabled if pushback is running,
  the planner is open, or the preferences window is active).
- `BetterPushback/abort_push`: Abort pushback during coupled push.
- `BetterPushback/manual_push_left`: Turn the tug left (manual push).
- `BetterPushback/manual_push_right`: Turn the tug right (manual push).
- `BetterPushback/manual_push_toggle`: Toggle manual push direction.
- `BetterPushback/manual_push_start`: Start/pause manual push (yoke used).
- `BetterPushback/manual_push_start_no_yoke`: Start/pause manual push (no yoke).

Note: For coupling add-ons, only `BetterPushback/start` is intended to be
mirrored to the slave. Other commands remain local.

### libacfutils Library Required

I removed from the project. It need to by downloaded separatly. To make sure you have a matched version, take the fork in my repository.
To connect with the library setup the Library in the "CMakeLists.txt" File in the "src" directory.

file(GLOB LIBACFUTILS "../../../libs/libacfutils")

As I found out in the last view days the relation to this library are very hard and many issues come from here ... it is not possible to splitup the library.

The library can be found here:
https://github.com/olivierbutler/libacfutils
