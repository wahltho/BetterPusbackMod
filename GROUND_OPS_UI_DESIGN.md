# Ground Operations UI Design

Status: contributor-tested corrections; final owner review pending
Last updated: 2026-09-16

Final local test evidence and platform limitations are recorded in
`OWNER_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`. SDK modernization remains a separate advisory
proposal in `SDK_440_REVIEW.md`; it is not implemented by these UI changes.

## Purpose

The ground operations interface must add immersion and control without covering
the cockpit. It is a compact operational companion to the existing overhead
planner, not a replacement for the planner and not a continuously running AI
dashboard.

The approved interaction is:

1. Hidden when no ground operation is relevant.
2. A narrow five-stage progress rail while the workflow is active.
3. A narrow vertical panel when the pilot clicks the rail.
4. Back to the rail when the pilot collapses the panel.
5. The existing overhead planner opens only when route review or editing is
   requested.

The startup workflow is fixed: display parsed airport context and a yellow
**Call tug** action immediately. There is no artificial dispatch timer. When
the pilot presses the button, the ground crew approaches and captures the nose
gear automatically, then stops before lift at the yellow **Plan push** gate.
Accepting a plan releases the controller into the lift and push sequence.

The pilot always controls whether the information panel is expanded. Normal
state changes must update the compact rail but must not unexpectedly cover the
cockpit.

## Design principles

- **Screen discipline:** the persistent presentation is the compact rail, not
  the panel.
- **One current task:** the expanded panel shows the action required now rather
  than a dashboard of every possible value.
- **Deterministic behavior:** proposed routes and status changes must explain
  their source; no opaque AI decision controls the aircraft.
- **Manual escape path:** the existing planner remains available at every
  planning decision.
- **Safety before convenience:** pause, safety hold, cancel, and abort are
  distinct operations.
- **Offline first:** network connectivity must never prevent an ordinary
  manual pushback.
- **No physics regression:** motion uses the upstream legacy planner,
  `drive_segs` steering, turn/endpoint behavior, and tug approach geometry.
  Ground Operations does not modify that path.

## Window modes

### Hidden

- No visible X-Plane window and no UI draw callback.
- Available before a ground operation through the plugin menu and a command.
- Applies only after a pilot hides the window during the current simulator
  session. The next simulator/plugin connection always starts visible.
- The startup presentation follows the ground-speed gate: it hides while the
  aircraft is taxiing and restores when the aircraft is stopped on the ground.
- A later pilot **Show** command is authoritative and can keep the presentation
  visible while moving; **Hide** removes that manual override.

### Compact progress rail

- Default active mode.
- Standard size on Windows/Linux is 58 by 244 boxels. Large is 73 by 305 and
  Extra large is 87 by 366. macOS retains its proportional 1.35 platform
  scale, including text and hit targets, before applying the selected user
  size.
- Contains the same Tug, Connect, Comms, Push, and Clear nodes used by the
  expanded panel, without any additional dashboard content.
- Completed stages are filled green. The current stage is bright green while
  automatic ground-crew or tug work is progressing, and amber/orange only while
  progress is blocked on a required pilot action. Future stages remain outlined
  in cyan.
- Entire rail is clickable.
- A click expands the narrow panel.
- Dragging moves the rail without expanding it. The implementation must use a
  small movement threshold to distinguish a click from a drag.
- Compact mode has no tooltips and never expands from hover; click to expand.
- With the global **Auto-expand for pilot actions** preference enabled, a new
  required action other than **Call tug** or **Call tow back** expands a
  visible compact rail. The panel collapses one second after the action clears
  whether it was expanded automatically or by the pilot. Hidden windows remain
  hidden, and a new action during the delay cancels the pending collapse. With
  the preference disabled, presentation changes remain entirely manual.
- Red is reserved for a future explicit fault or safety-stop state reported by
  the controller. Normal pilot gates, deliberate pause holds, disconnect
  approval, and destructive alternatives do not make a stage red.
- No timer-based animation may imply progress while the operation is waiting.

### Expanded panel

- Standard size on Windows/Linux is 292 by 420 boxels. Large is 365 by 525 and
  Extra large is 438 by 630. macOS retains its proportional 1.35 platform
  scale, including text and hit targets, before applying the selected user
  size.
- Narrow vertical layout with a five-stage rail on the left.
- The upper-left grip/title region moves the window.
- Drawn pop-out/in, minus and close controls do not depend on font glyphs.
- Click minus, dwell over minus for one uninterrupted second, or click the
  progress rail to collapse. Brief flyovers/dragging do not collapse the panel.
- First collapse docks to the nearest left/right edge. Compact resting
  positions are movable and remembered per window mode, monitor and side.
- When the rail touches the left edge, the panel expands rightward. When it
  touches the right edge, the panel expands leftward. The whole window is
  constrained to the available monitor bounds when it fits. Native pop-out
  recovery waits for the geometry to settle so cross-monitor dragging works.
- Only the content for the current state is rendered.

The panel is divided into:

1. **Title:** Ground operations, flight identity, and current status.
2. **Briefing strip:** airport, simulator wind and temperature, and QNH.
3. **Stage rail:** Tug, Connect, Comms, Push, Clear.
4. **Current-task area:** status, explanation, and valid actions.
5. **Source footer:** data provenance and offline state.

### Planner transition

- Clicking Manual planner or Edit opens the existing overhead planner.
- The panel collapses to the compact rail before the planner camera opens.
- The compact rail is hidden while the overhead planner owns the screen.
- Closing the planner restores the previous panel mode unless the workflow has
  advanced to a state that requires a different presentation.
- The planner remains the authoritative manual route editor.

## Positioning and monitors

The interface will use a modern `XPImgWindow` window. The included window layer
already supports floating, pop-out, and VR modes through `WndMode`.

Required behavior:

- Free movement inside X-Plane.
- Pop out into a first-class operating-system window.
- Move the popped-out window to another monitor.
- Return the window to X-Plane without losing the workflow state.
- Remember floating and popped-out geometry separately.
- Validate saved coordinates against the currently connected monitors.
- Recover to a visible default position if a remembered monitor no longer
  exists.
- Respect X-Plane UI scaling and high-DPI coordinates.

Persisted UI state covers:

- current presentation mode plus the last visible compact or panel mode;
- floating geometry;
- popped-out operating-system geometry;
- preferred monitor.

Platform scale is selected at build time. Windows/Linux use 1.0; macOS uses
1.35. The user preference then applies a 1.0, 1.25, or 1.5 multiplier to the
complete interface. A development build can enable `BP_EMULATE_MAC_UI_SCALE`.

Exact key names are an implementation detail, but configuration migration must
be backward compatible.

At startup, a saved compact or expanded presentation is restored visibly. A
saved hidden presentation restores the last visible presentation instead. If
no visible history exists, as on a first install or migration from an older
hidden state, the expanded panel is the default. Startup visibility is automatic,
so the ground-speed gate may hide the window while taxiing and restore it after
the aircraft stops. An explicit pilot Show/Hide choice remains authoritative.

## Workflow stages and existing pushback states

The UI uses a stable five-stage model and maps the more detailed controller
states into it. The UI must never infer motion merely from a caption string.

| Existing state | UI stage | Live status | Pilot action/control |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PB_STEP_OFF` | Tug/pre-push | Controller idle or the active pre-push state | Defined by the pre-push state |
| `PB_STEP_TUG_LOAD` | Tug | Selecting a compatible tug | No |
| `PB_STEP_START` | Tug | Ground crew dispatching tug, or Tug standing by | No |
| `PB_STEP_DRIVING_UP_CLOSE` | Tug | Tug approaching aircraft | No |
| `PB_STEP_WAITING_FOR_DOORS` | Tug | Ground crew clearing aircraft service | No amber gate in the automatic connection workflow |
| `PB_STEP_OPENING_CRADLE` | Tug | Preparing the tug cradle | No |
| `PB_STEP_WAITING_FOR_PBRAKE` | Connect | Ground crew connection checks | Automatically secured; no pilot gate in connect-first workflow |
| `PB_STEP_DRIVING_UP_CONNECT` | Connect | Positioning tug to connect | No |
| `PB_STEP_GRABBING` | Connect | Securing the nose gear | No |
| `PB_STEP_LIFTING` | Comms while awaiting plan, then Connect while lifting | Tug connected; plan the push, then Lifting the nose gear | Amber Plan push after capture and before lift |
| `PB_STEP_CONNECTED` | Comms | Ready for brake release, or late plan required | Change plan while the parking brake is set; otherwise release brake or complete plan |
| `PB_STEP_STARTING` | Push | Starting pushback | No |
| `PB_STEP_PUSHING` | Push | Pushback in progress, Pausing, or Pushback paused | Pause/Resume plus confirmed End operation |
| `PB_STEP_STOPPING` | Push | Stopping the aircraft | No |
| `PB_STEP_STOPPED` | Push | Aircraft stopped | Yes: set parking brake |
| `PB_STEP_LOWERING` | Clear | Lowering the nose gear | No |
| `PB_STEP_UNGRABBING` | Clear | Releasing the nose gear | No |
| `PB_STEP_WAITING4OK2DISCO` | Clear | Ready to disconnect | Manual mode: **Disconnect tug** or **Reconnect** in the Ground Operations panel; automatic mode approves disconnect without pilot input |
| `PB_STEP_MOVING_AWAY` | Clear | Tug moving clear | No |
| `PB_STEP_CLOSING_CRADLE` | Clear | Closing the tug cradle | No |
| `PB_STEP_STARTING2CLEAR` | Clear | Driver moving to clear | No |
| `PB_STEP_MOVING2CLEAR` | Clear | Driver moving to clear | No |
| `PB_STEP_CLEAR_SIGNAL` | Clear | Clear signal displayed | Manual mode: acknowledge the displayed pin/clear signal; automatic mode acknowledges it internally; both retain the original 15-second minimum |
| `PB_STEP_DRIVING_AWAY` | Clear | Tug returning to station | Informational: Finalize cockpit checklist |

Pre-push presentation remains separate from `bp.step`:

| Pre-push state | UI stage | Live status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Airport data | Tug | Parsed airport identifier; yellow Call tug action |
| Planner review | Comms | Reviewing pushback plan |
| Operation complete | Clear | All five stages complete |

States before `bp_start()`—airport data loaded and ground crew scheduled—
belong to the new ground-operations controller and must not be forced into
`bp.step`.

## Current-task views

### Airport context and automatic connection

Displays only active, simulator-local information:

- Assigned flight number, falling back to aircraft type.
- Departure airport.
- Simulator wind and temperature.
- QNH in hPa and inHg.

The Phase 5 local-provider slice parses and displays the nearest airport,
standard simulator Flight ID when available, and current simulator wind,
temperature, and QNH. It labels the source and freshness explicitly. EOBT,
METAR, and ATIS are not part of the active Ground Operations presentation. The
UI immediately offers the yellow **Call tug** action. After that call,
approach and capture proceed with no second pilot gate until the controller is
holding before lift.

The standard Flight ID is preferred when it contains a valid assigned value.
When it is blank or identical to the aircraft ICAO code, the aircraft ICAO type
(for example, `B737`) is displayed as the fallback identity. Simulator weather
uses a fixed, non-rotating three-line briefing layout: airport,
wind-temperature, and QNH in both hPa and inHg. The panel uses ASCII-safe
control and stage labels so it does not depend on an icon font. Helper text
requires a stationary delayed hover, uses no shared hover delay, and is removed
on the first frame after the pointer leaves the control.

Unavailable active data uses ASCII `--` or an explicit "Unavailable" label.
The UI must not fabricate a flight identity or weather value.

### Tug staged

- Tug approaching or standing by.
- Door/GPU/ASU readiness when supported.
- Towbar or towbarless connection progression.
- No pilot action until a real action is required.

### Ready for communications

- Primary action: Open interphone.
- Towbar, bypass-pin, and safety-area status.
- Captions mirror the relevant ground-crew message.
- Manual planner remains available.

### Manual push planning

- The overhead planner opens in the original manual-placement workflow. It does
  not infer a departure direction or seed route geometry from wind or runways.
- The pilot moves and rotates the planner cursor, clicks to place the desired
  aircraft pose, and explicitly accepts the completed route.
- A route already drawn in the current planner session may be preserved.
- Persistent route reuse is available only when the live nosewheel uniquely
  matches a published `apt.dat` start within 1 m and 1 degree. Two isolated
  route slots are available per published gate and compatible aircraft profile.
- The derived airport database records an ordered manifest of active `apt.dat`
  inputs, including existence, file size, and modification time. A changed
  manifest invalidates and rebuilds only the airport database at startup;
  persistent gate-route slots are stored separately and remain untouched.
- An arbitrary or saved-situation start remains usable for the current session,
  but it cannot list, load, save, or modify persistent gate-route slots.
- The planner's blue legacy route and magenta danger band remain visual
  review tools and do not claim automatic obstacle clearance.

### Brake release

- Communication action acknowledges the pilot call.
- The plugin separately verifies the actual parking-brake dataref.
- Movement cannot begin while the simulator still reports the brake set.
- The UI explains the mismatch instead of forcing the brake state.

### Push in progress

- Current instruction or tail direction.
- Actual tug/aircraft speed.
- Route distance remaining.
- Overall progress.
- Pause/Resume and Safety stop.

Pause is a controlled deceleration to a hold. Resume retains the route and
steering-controller state and uses the proven acceleration ramp. Safety stop is
a hold with a prominent reason. Cancel/abort is separate and requires explicit
confirmation because it can terminate the operation.

### Disconnect

- Parking-brake verification.
- Lowering, towbar/cradle release, and tug movement status.
- Driver presentation setting: left, ahead, or right.
- Equipment-clear completion.

Disconnect approval uses the highlighted **PILOT ACTION** card with the task
**Cleared to disconnect**, a yellow **Disconnect tug** button and secondary
**Reconnect**. The clear-signal card retains **Verify the clear signal**, with a
yellow **Acknowledge** button. Required task cards use an amber background,
yellow heading and left accent. Optional controls retain secondary styling;
destructive End operation confirmation retains its separate warning treatment.

The global **Auto disconnect when done** preference is off by default and is
persisted across simulator starts for all aircraft.
When enabled, the controller takes over only after the requested parking brake
has been set. It approves the disconnect gate and acknowledges the clear-signal
gate without pilot input while retaining the physical release sequence, audio,
side-clear movement, signal presentation, and 15-second minimum display time.

During departure, the neutral **CURRENT TASK** is **Finalize cockpit checklist**.
After completion all five stages are green; visibility follows the legacy
ground/speed gate, not an invented completion timer.

Buttons provide hover, pressed and short activation feedback. Preferences has
a **Button click volume** slider (0-100%, zero mutes), with preview on release.
Adjustments apply immediately; Save preferences keeps them across reloads.
Unset volume defaults to 35%; saved values and legacy mute take precedence.
Click audio uses optional SDK sound functions and does not change crew/tug
audio. Preferences remains unavailable during an active pushback.

### Emergency return tow

- After a normal operation and final tug departure, the completed view offers
  the optional blue **Call tow back** action.
- Emergency Tow is a small session coordinator around the existing
  connect-first workflow, manual planner, tug physics, and disconnect sequence;
  it does not duplicate those controllers.
- Once the nose gear is captured, the planner opens automatically at the live
  aircraft position with an empty one-time route. Saved-route listing, loading,
  replacement, and writing are hard-disabled for the entire emergency session.
- The wing walker is neither allocated nor rendered during Emergency Tow.
- After the tug disconnects and completes its drive-away, the coordinator ends
  and Ground Operations returns to the same cold-start **Tug available** state
  used after a simulator start.
- A later normal operation again uses the normal published-start guard. If the
  returned aircraft is off its unique `apt.dat` anchor, the route remains
  session-only and no cache file can be created or changed.

### Marshaller presentation

- The global **Display marshaller** preference defaults on and prevents object
  allocation entirely when disabled.
- The normal-operation position preserves the 30-yard nose clearance and
  captain-side offset. It is captured when the first visible signal begins,
  including while asynchronous object loading is still completing.
- Position and heading remain anchored for the rest of the operation. Aircraft
  movement after the signal begins cannot pull the marshaller along.
- The current object heading is rotated 180 degrees from its earlier runtime
  orientation so the visible character faces the aircraft.

## Data sources and precedence

Each external value carries source, fetched time, and expiry time.

### Flight identity

1. Simulator/aircraft flight-number datarefs when available.
2. Aircraft ICAO type.
3. Unavailable.

### Weather

1. Simulator weather for operational calculations.
2. Unavailable display, while manual planning remains usable.

### Departure-flow context

1. Route explicitly drawn in the current planner session.
2. One-time coarse flow inferred from X-Plane wind and loaded paved-runway
   geometry.
3. No suggestion; open the unchanged manual planner.

Parallel runways are grouped by direction, so the inference can say NORTH or
SOUTH without choosing a runway. Calm wind, crossing-runway ties, unsupported
geometry, or an unreachable planner endpoint produce no suggestion.

## UI architecture

The first implementation will add separate ground-operations UI files instead
of expanding `cfg.cpp`.

Proposed boundaries:

- `ground_ops_state.[ch]`: fixed-size snapshot and pure mapping from plugin
  state to UI state.
- `ground_ops_ui.cpp/.h`: `XPImgWindow` compact-rail/panel rendering and local
  UI intent.
- Operational button intent is queued out of the draw callback and dispatched
  through the existing X-Plane command handlers on the manager flight loop.
- `ground_ops_data.*`: optional cached flight/weather providers added after the
  inert UI is stable.
- `emergency_tow.[ch]`: bounded session lifecycle plus the hard persistent-route
  and wing-walker policy gates; motion and planning remain in existing modules.

The UI reads one immutable `ground_ops_snapshot_t` containing fixed-size or
preformatted values. It does not walk route lists, parse JSON, probe terrain,
or read arbitrary datarefs during drawing.

The initial shell was read-only through early Phase 3. The corrected workflow
adds **Call tug**, **Plan push**, **Pause/Resume**, and confirmed **End
operation** buttons. Call tug starts the existing connect-first workflow only
when pressed. Pause commands zero
speed through the normal deceleration model while retaining route and steering
state. The stationary hold freezes steering and cannot resume through a set
parking brake. End operation uses the compatible terminating stop path and
discards the route only after confirmation.

The global **Pushback interface** preference selects the fork's Ground
Operations panel or the original **Legacy magic squares** at runtime. The
selection is global, remembered, and mutually exclusive: only the selected
interface owns operational windows and update loops. Switching is allowed only
while the pushback controller and planner are idle.

Legacy mode restores the original per-aircraft **Magic squares position**
slider. Position changes are queued to the simulator callback and move the
existing windows without destroying them from inside the Preferences draw
callback.

The switch affects presentation and pilot interaction only. Automatic
beacon-triggered tug behavior is evaluated separately, and the shared planner,
preferences, commands, controller, cache, and tug physics remain available.
Ground Operations exposes **Disconnect tug**, **Reconnect**, and clear-signal
acknowledgement in the panel. Legacy mode restores its original floating
disconnect/reconnect buttons and timed clear-signal departure. If the global
**Auto disconnect when done** option is enabled, the controller approves the
post-push gates automatically in either mode.

## Performance contract

- Hidden mode schedules no UI update loop and receives no draw calls.
- Compact rail and panel use X-Plane's normal window draw callback only while
  visible.
- State strings, icons, ring percentage, and button availability update only on
  snapshot changes.
- No route prediction, terrain probing, network I/O, JSON parsing, disk I/O, or
  logging occurs in a draw callback.
- No recurring network poll is tied to frame rate.
- After UI warm-up, the draw path performs no plugin-owned heap allocation.
- The ground-operations coordinator is event-driven and may use a low-rate
  scheduled tick only while an active workflow requires one.

The Phase 3 implementation quantizes speed to 0.1 m/s and remaining distance to
whole meters before comparing inputs. Metric-only changes update the snapshot
without producing semantic transition logs. Captions are always enabled and
mirror an issued crew message only for that message's audio duration, including
when simulator sound is disabled.

The late-plan pre-lift hold is exposed explicitly rather than inferred from
`PB_STEP_LIFTING`: once nose-gear capture is complete, the UI advances to Comms
and shows the yellow **Plan push** gate while lift position remains zero. After
plan acceptance, the same legacy enum continues into the physical lift.
- Any worker thread blocks on a condition variable or timed job and never busy
  waits.
- Worker threads never call XPLM APIs. Results cross to the main thread through
  a bounded queue or immutable snapshot.

Target measured overhead on the reference test system:

| Mode | Average plugin UI CPU target |
| --- | ---: |
| Hidden | effectively zero |
| Compact rail | no more than 0.10 ms per rendered frame |
| Panel | no more than 0.20 ms per rendered frame |

These are acceptance ceilings, not targets to consume. Lower is expected.

## Failure and recovery behavior

- Network timeout: show cached data if valid, otherwise Unavailable.
- Malformed response: discard it and retain the last valid snapshot.
- Missing flight plan: retain full manual functionality.
- Missing monitor: restore on the primary X-Plane monitor.
- Aircraft reload: close unsafe actions, rebuild aircraft context, and retain
  only safe window preferences.
- Plugin reload: do not resume a partially connected or moving tug.
- UI exception or failed allocation: hide the new UI and leave classic menu
  commands available.
- Planner prediction failure: retain the existing geometric fallback and log a
  bounded diagnostic once per route revision.

## Accessibility and usability

- High-DPI and X-Plane UI scaling supported.
- Status never depends on color alone; stage labels and text provide the
  meaning. Completed stages are green, an automatically progressing current
  stage is bright green, a pilot-blocked current stage is amber/orange, and
  future stages are cyan. No separate warning badge is drawn.
- Compact rail labels use locale-specific short forms that fit the fixed rail
  width at every supported scale. Full translated wording belongs in the
  expanded status and task regions; a long translation must never be clipped
  into a neighboring panel region.
- Essential controls remain labeled in the panel.
- Every variable status, detail, caption, task, metric, and action label is
  measured against its drawing rectangle. Text wraps where appropriate and
  reduces to a bounded fallback size before drawing so it cannot run outside
  the panel or its card.
- Compact-rail hover text provides the current status.
- Menu commands exist for show/hide, expand/collapse, pause/resume, and safety
  stop so pilots can bind hardware or keyboard shortcuts.
- The panel avoids automatic expansion; the yellow current-stage label and
  voice/caption prompts request attention without implying an error.
- Text localization uses the existing translation system.

## Explicitly out of scope for the first UI phases

- Large-language-model inference inside the plugin.
- Continuous AI monitoring.
- Automatic obstacle detection for buildings, aircraft, or vehicles.
- Rewriting aircraft FMOD packages.
- Replacing the tested push controller.
- Silently issuing or interpreting real ATC clearance.

These items require separate feasibility, licensing, performance, and safety
work and are not prerequisites for the approved ground-operations experience.
